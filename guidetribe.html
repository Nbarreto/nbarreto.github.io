        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>There is a lot to look forward to when planning a trip, but planning on your own can be time-consuming and overwhelming.  In addition to having to sift through the seemingly endless amount of sights to explore and prioritizing, there is the added task of pooling it all into a harmonious itinerary.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="casebox">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>An application that makes exploring new cities easier by crowdsourcing reliable walking routes and itineraries from those who know these cities the best - locals and past visitors.</p>

<!-- PHASE 1 -->
<div class="phase">
  <h3>PHASE 1 : DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT</h3>

  <div class="survey-interviews">
    <h2>Survey/Interviews</h2>
    <p>Before delving into the design of GuideTribe, I needed to better understand:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>whether there was a need for a tool like this, </li>
      <li>who would use this tool, and </li>
      <li>what types of features the tool should include</li>
    </ol>
      <p>I conducted <strong>two surveys</strong> and <strong>one round of interviews. </strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="survey-findings">
    <h4>SURVEY FINDINGS</h4>
    <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/Survey Findings.png"  alt="survey findings" width=50%>
  </div>
  <div class="interview-findings">
    <h4>INTERVIEW FINDINGS</h4>
    <p>During my user interviews, I asked questions that probed into past planning experiences and behaviors.  These interviews revealed some major pain points while planning:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Planning takes a significant effort since it takes time to research sightseeing destinations and to consolidate it all into a well thought out itinerary.</li>
      <li>There isn’t a centralized tool that allows one to plot destinations on a map, determine route length and timing, and to discover more information about these destinations.</li>
      <li>General research typically only produces “touristy” results but is void of “local” recommendations.</li>
      <li>It is difficult to use existing tools like Tripadvisor and Google Maps when there is no access to WIFI or cellular service.</li>
      <li>Current methods of route navigation are limited to plotting locations in Google Maps point by point.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="personas">
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p>Of those interviewed, I selected three participants that I felt best represented Guide Tribe user goals and pain points to generate personas.</p>
    <img src="#" alt=personas>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/16DJ3qnIgnlbAdexNghf0G72r4JyqJ7oX/" class="btn">SEE FULL PERSONAS ANALYSIS</a>
    <p>Based on these findings, it was clear that a need for a mobile based tool that facilitated sightseeing trip planning existed.  It was also clear that sightseers could benefit from an application that sourced route and location recommendations from past visitors and locals.</p>
    <h4>PERSONA GOALS</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Reduce trip planning time</li>
      <li>A way to build personalized itinerary of sights</li>
      <li>A way to consolidate trip information into one application</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="competitive-analysis">
    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>I created a SWOT matrix combining data from four competitor products: Google Trips, Detour, LiveTrekker and SideKix.</p>
    <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/Guidetribe Competitive Analysis.png" alt="competitive analysis" width=100%>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18BIDVoNiJ1ZOCZ5bMOfA0kEDCGclsCXZ/" class="btn">DOWNLOAD COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</a>
    <p>Based on this research, it was clear that the application should focus on ease of use to ensure a low barrier of entry, and that an ability to generate personal customized maps could be a competitive advantage.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="user-flows">
    <h2>User Flows</h2>
    <p>Focusing on the main tasks of GuideTribe users, I created a number of user stories and task flows which informed the site maps for five of the most important user flows.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>New user sign-up</li>
      <li>Returning user log-in</li>
      <li>Searching for and selecting a walking route</li>
      <li>Creating and submitting a walking route</li>
      <li>Upgrading account</li>
    </ol>

<!-- PHASE 2 -->
<div class="phase">
  <h3>PHASE 2 : WIREFRAMING AND TESTING</h3>

<div class="wireframes">
  <h2>Wireframes</h2>
  <p>I translated my design notes and site maps into sketches  to define the placement of elements on each page.</p>
  <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/Wireframe Sketch.jpg" alt="LF sketch" width=100%>
  <p>Next, I developed low-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq that I used to build a clickable prototype in Invision to conduct preliminary testing with potential users.</p>
  <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/LOFI Wireframes.png" alt="LF wireframe" width=100%>
  <p>I then created high fidelity wireframes and a prototype using Figma that included written content for each screen.</p>
  <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/HIFI Wireframes.png" alt="HF wireframe" width=50%>
</div>

<div class="usability-testing">
  <div class="test">
    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
    <p>I conducted three rounds of user testing on my high fidelity wireframes.</p>
    <h4>USABILITY TEST #1</h4>
    <p>I conducted three rounds of user testing on my High Fidelity wireframes.  I used Maze to conduct my first round of testing.  Of the 3 total participants, 2 had failed to complete the task that asked them to create a custom route.  Specifically, participants had the most difficulty with figuring out how to draw their custom map once destinations were added to it. The image below displays the activity of a participant that struggled with drawing their custom route.  Ultimately, this user gave up.</p>
    <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/Hotspot Testing.png" alt="user testing" width=50%>
    <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/Hotspot Testing - comment.png" alt="user testing" width=50%>
    <p>In light of this data, it was clear that the creation of a custom route needed resolving, especially since it is a core function of the application.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="test">
    <h4>USABILITY TEST #2</h4>
    <p>In an effort to solve this problem, I conducted 2 in-person usability tests to delve deeper into the issues that stood in the way of success.  Several insights came out of these in-person tests:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The process for adding location pins via the search function was not obvious.</li>
      <li>The “draw” icon did not match mental models.</li>
      <li>Even when clicking on the “draw” icon to activate the function, linking locations required numerous clicks and did not provide options that allowed:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The selection of start/end locations</li>
        <li>Modification of location order</li>
        <li>Deletion of a location</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
      <p>This feedback proved that creating a custom map needed to be simpler with less steps, and provide prompts that allowed for the more intuitive functions shared during the in-person usability tests.  In response to this feedback, I re-imagined this area.  Since incorporating these features into the “map build” made for a more complex experience, I replaced the “map build” with a “list build.”  Users would generate a list of locations that can be re-ordered by dragging, and edited within the list view.  This list can then be viewed on a map in its listed order.</p>
      <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/HIFI Map Build - After.png" alt="custom map build" width=100%>
    <h4>Usability Test #3</h4>
    <p>I conducted a third round of in-person testing with 3 users to evaluate the usability of the updated prototype. I utilized the “record” feature on my iphone to document these usability tests.  Each test took approximately 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>Users were asked to complete the following tasks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sign-up for an account</li>
      <li>Search for and select a route in New York City</li>
      <li>Create a custom route</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="#" alt="screen recording">
    <p>The updates that were tested during the third usability test revealed improvement to users ability to create a custom route.  This was evident by the unanimous rating of 4 out of 5 for ease of use.  Specifically, users were pleased with the ease when searching for and modifying their custom route locations.</p>

  <!-- PHASE 3 -->
  <div class="phase">
    <h3>PHASE 3 : VISUAL DESIGN</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="branding">
    <h2>Branding</h2>
    <p>Having completed user testing, I developed a brand identity to incorporate into my final design mockups.</p>
    <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/Guide Tribe Style.png" alt="style tile" width=100%>
    <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/K7u02xGB1cC7Umj9mQAx3Agb/Guide-Tribe-Style-Guide" class="btn">SEE COMPLETE STYLE GUIDE</a>
    <h2>Design Mockup</h2>
    <p>I applied branding guidelines to my high fidelity wireframes.</p>
    <p>In order to address a concern around visibility of the search icon, I performed a preference test on the search component.</p>
    <img src="#" alt="preference test">
    <p>Based on the results, users preferred the <strong>option "B".</strong></p>
  </div>

  <!-- REFLECTION -->
    <div class="reflection">
      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="reflection-content">
      <p>This project strengthened my appreciation for the insights users have to offer.  Throughout user testings, I consistently found myself diving deeper into their expectations and ideas which helped drive changes to design and flow, and was ultimately instrumental in the shift to a “list built” map.</p>
