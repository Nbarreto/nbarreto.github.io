        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>There is a lot to look forward to when planning a trip, but planning on your own can be time-consuming and overwhelming.  In addition to having to sift through the seemingly endless amount of sights to explore and prioritizing, there is the added task of pooling it all into a harmonious itinerary.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="casebox">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>An application that makes exploring new cities easier by crowdsourcing reliable walking routes and itineraries from those who know these cities the best - locals and past visitors.</p>

<div class="phase">
  <h3>PHASE 1 : DISCOVERY AND RESEARCH</h3>
</div>

  <div class="survey-interviews">
    <h2>Survey/Interviews</h2>
    <p>Before delving into the design of GuideTribe, I needed to better understand:</p>
      <li>whether there was a need for a tool like this, </li>
      <li>who would use this tool, and </li>
      <li>what types of features the tool should include</li>
      <p>I conducted <strong>two surveys</strong> and <strong>one round of interviews</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="survey-findings">
    <h4>SURVEY FINDINGS</h4>
    <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/Survey Findings.png"  alt="survey findings" width=50%>
  </div>
  <div class="interview-findings">
    <h4>INTERVIEW FINDINGS</h4>
    <p>During my user interviews, I asked questions that probed into past planning experiences and behaviors.  These interviews revealed some major pain points while planning:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Planning takes a significant effort since it takes time to research sightseeing destinations and to consolidate it all into a well thought out itinerary.</li>
      <li>There isn’t a centralized tool that allows one to plot destinations on a map, determine route length and timing, and to discover more information about these destinations.</li>
      <li>General research typically only produces “touristy” results but is void of “local” recommendations.</li>
      <li>It is difficult to use existing tools like Tripadvisor and Google Maps when there is no access to WIFI or cellular service.</li>
      <li>Current methods of route navigation are limited to plotting locations in Google Maps point by point.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="personas">
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p>Of those interviewed, I selected three participants that I felt best represented Guide Tribe user goals and pain points to generate personas.</p>
    <img src="#" alt=personas">
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/16DJ3qnIgnlbAdexNghf0G72r4JyqJ7oX" class="btn">SEE FULL PERSONAS ANALYSIS"</a>
    <p>Based on these findings, it was clear that a need for a mobile based tool that facilitated sightseeing trip planning existed.  It was also clear that sightseers could benefit from an application that sourced route and location recommendations from past visitors and locals.</p>
    <h4>PERSONA GOALS</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Reduce trip planning time</li>
      <li>A way to build personalized itinerary of sights</li>
      <li>A way to consolidate trip information into one application</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="competitive-analysis">
    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>I created a SWOT matrix combining data from four competitor products: Google Trips, Detour, LiveTrekker and SideKix.</p>
    <p>Based on this research, it was clear that the application should focus on ease of use to ensure a low barrier of entry, and that an ability to generate personal customized maps could be a competitive advantage.</p>
