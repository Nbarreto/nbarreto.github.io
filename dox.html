        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Dox is an SaaS (software as a service) web application that allows users to collect information such as links, images and notes and store them in a single place, sharing and collaborating on them with other users.</p>
        <p>The design includes a homepage that advertises features and pricing options for paid accounts, onboarding screens to sign-up and login, a dashboard where users can view their saved content, and an account page where users have the option to upgrade their account.</p>
        <p>Dox was built as an exercise for the Bloc.io User Experience Design track.</p>

<div class="phase">
  <h3>PHASE 1 : DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT</h3>

  <div class="survey-interviews">
    <h2>Survey</h2>
    <p>First, I needed to identify who the potential users would be and better understand their behaviors and needs.  I conducted a survey that asked about current digital behaviors with smartphones, tablets and computers, current content saving tools and habits, and demographic information.</p>
    <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/en8OUe7DcvnxzWgC2" class="btn">VIEW SURVEY</a>
    <p>The survey revealed valuable information about how users saved and accessed their personal and professional information such as links, photos and notes.  It also revealed what tools they were using, what features were sought out, and where these tools were lacking.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="survey-findings">
    <h4>SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
    <ul class="highlights">
      <li>100% browse the internet using their smartphone and more than half use their laptop.  News, social networks and videos were most often searched for when browsing online.</li>
      <li>70%  save links or images that they find interesting.  This content is most often saved by bookmarking using their browser.  Respondents noted difficulty with managing these bookmarks and keeping them organized.</li>
      <li>60% take notes for either personal or business and use their smartphone to do this.  Respondents seem to value simplicity and the ability to sync their notes with all of their devices.</li>
      <li>85% use social media to sign up for accounts on other websites due to its ease and speed.</li>
      <li>100 % work in collaborative work environments and the majority share resources and collaborate with their co-workers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Based on this information, it is clear that we’ll need to create a platform that is accessible on a different types of devices and that allows for syncing content across these devices. Since managing bookmarks is an area of difficulty, we will need to focus on ways to organize saved items.  We will want to ensure that Dox is simple to use and that collaboration is easy.  Social media should be a feature available for use when signing up for an account.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="personas">
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p>I conducted in-depth interviews with three of the respondents to dive deeper into this data, to better understand who I would be designing DOX for and to ensure I am able to make informed decisions about DOX’s functionality and design.  These interviews helped me build personas that represent DOX's user goals and pain points.</p>
    <div class="persona-wrapper">

    </ul>
      <div class="persona-content">
        <h6>MOTIVATION</h6>
        <p>Amit  is  an  avid  reader  and  frequently  saves  articles  to  read  when  he  is  on  the  go.    Since  heis  constantly  on  the  move,  he  most  often  uses  his  cell  phone  to  browse  the  internet  for  interesting  articles  or  content.    He  likes  to  be  able  to  access  content  from  anywhere,  not  juston  his  computer.    He  currently  works  in  a  very  collaborative  environment  and  uses  GoogleDrive  to  partner  with  his  colleagues  on  projects  in  real-time  but  finds  that  comments  andedits  crowd  the  document,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  read.</p>
          <h6>FRUSTRATIONS</h6>
          <ul class="frustrations">
          <li>Downloaded material takes up too much space on device</li>
          <li>Collaborating with others can become messy and documents are overburdened</li>

          <p>Nicole  is  a  busy  mom  and  student,  so  she  relies  on  her  phone  to  keep  track  of  daily  activitiesand  to  save  content  that  is  useful  to  her.    She  typically  uses  Pinterest,  bookmarks  or  takes  screenshots  to  save  content  related  to  her  coursework,  baking  and  helpful  parenting  articles.    Since  her  commute  to  school  into  the  city  is  long  and  she  often  does  not  have  access  to  the  internet,  she  would  like  to  be  able  to  access  content  off-line.</p>

  <div class="competitive-analysis">
    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>I conducted a SWOT analysis to evaluate three competitors: Pinterest, Box and Evernote.</p>

    <div class="comp-wrapper">
    <div class="competitor">
      <img src="assets/DOX/evernote.png" alt="google" width="50%">
      <div class="comp-content">
        <h4>Evernote</h4>
        <p>Is a well-known notetaking tool and also has the ability to store images, documents and web clippings.  The interface, however, can be difficult to use and the free version does not permit off-line viewing.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="competitor">
      <img src="assets/DOX/box.png" alt="detour" width=50%>
      <div class="comp-content">
        <h4>Box</h4>
        <p>Let's you securely manage, share and access saved content and puts an emphasis on their collaborative features, but real-time collaboration is difficult because people cannot work on the same document simultaneously, and is impractical for users that are just looking to store content for personal use.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="competitor">
      <img src="assets/DOX/pinterest.png" alt="livetrekker" width=50%>
      <div class="comp-content">
        <h4>Pinterest</h4>
        <p>Offers a quick and easy way to store and organize images and articles with one-click.  It does not, however, provide the capability to save other types of documents and is directed towards creatives.</p>

    <p>Based on this research, it was clear that <strong>the application should focus on ease of use to ensure a low barrier of entry</strong>, and that <strong>an ability to generate personal customized maps could be a competitive advantage.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="user-flows">
    <h2>User Stories and User Flows</h2>
    <p>Focusing on the main tasks of DOX users, I developed user stories for both new and returning users since each have different paths they take to achieve their goals for certain tasks.  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Explore the features of DOX</li>
      <li>Sign-up/sign-in using social logins or email and password</li>
      <li>Navigate to the dashboard after signing up</li>
      <li>Reset password</li>
      <li>Adding new content (link, image or text-based note)</li>
      <li>Creating a new Dox Box</li>
      <li>Updating account settings</li>
      <li>Inviting and managing collaborators</li>
      <li>Viewing content</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Using these stories, I created a series of user flows that reflect the paths and actions a user would take to:</p>

<div class="phase">
  <h3>PHASE 2 : VISUAL DESIGN</h3>
</div>

<div class="branding">
  <h2>Branding</h2>
  <p>The name was inspired by the concept of a shipping dock.  Like a Dock, Dox is a hub where images, links and notes are unloaded, giving direct access to users and collaborators.  While designing the logo, I wanted to create something that was simple and clean so I opted to use basic shapes.  After conducting a preference test, I ultimately settled on my own interpretation of a ship’s sail (1A, 1B).</p>
  <img src="assets/DOX/Dox Logo.png" alt="logo design" width=100%>
  <p>I chose blue and orange tones to convey that Dox is a reliable and trustworthy (blue tones) productivity tool that aims to facilitate collaboration and communication (orange tones) among users.</p>

<!-- PHASE 3 -->
<div class="phase">
  <h3>PHASE 3 : WIREFRAMING AND TESTING</h3>

<div class="wireframes">
  <h2>Wireframes & Usability Tests</h2>
  <p>I translated my design notes and site maps into sketches to define the placement of elements for the homepage and dashboard.</p>
  <img src="assets/DOX/Dox LF.png" alt="LF sketch" width=100%>
  <p>After receiving informal feedback, I created an Invision prototype that I could test with potential users. The results of those user tests informed multiple iterations of flow design due to issues with wording and button placement.  Specifically, there were instances where instructions and prompts were unclear to users and that the placement of buttons did not adhere to user mental models.</p>
  <img src="assets/DOX/Artboard 2@2x.png" alt="LF wireframe" width=100%>
  <p>I designed high fidelity mockups in Sketch and Photoshop, incorporating the color palette, typography, visuals and further content details.  I used Invision to create a prototype for my high fidelity wireframes to conduct more in-depth usability tests on UserTesting.com.  I also conducted a Navigation Test on UsabilityHub.com to better understand how users are maneuvering through the site.  While, ultimately, users were able to navigate the site successfully, feedback from the usability tests led to changes to the placement of the dashboard menu.  Specifically, users favored a top menu bar as opposed to the original left oriented menu.</p>

      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="reflection-content">
      <p>I came out of this project with a real appreciation for the value of user research when designing a product.  The insights that came out of my own research addressed issues in the design process that helped produce a product that catered to user needs.</p>
      <p>If given more time I would have made minor adjustments to my design, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refining the footer in the homepage so that it doesn’t look as tight when in mobile and tablet formats</li>
        <li>Clarify terminology specific to DOX to new users on the homepage, i.e. what is a box?</li>
        <li>Add an internal search option to the dashboard to easily locate specific items</li>
        <li>Make it easier to locate additional features from the dashboard, i.e. collaboration</li>
