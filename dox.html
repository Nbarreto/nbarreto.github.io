        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>There is a lot to look forward to when planning a trip, but planning on your own can be time-consuming and overwhelming.  In addition to having to sift through the seemingly endless amount of sights to explore and prioritizing, there is the added task of pooling it all into a harmonious itinerary.</p>

      <li class="casebox">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>An application that makes exploring new cities easier by crowdsourcing reliable walking routes and itineraries from those who know these cities the best - locals and past visitors.</p>

  <h3>PHASE 1 : DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT</h3>

  <div class="survey-interviews">
    <h2>Survey</h2>
    <p>First, I needed to identify who the potential users would be and better understand their behaviors and needs.  I conducted a survey that asked about current digital behaviors with smartphones, tablets and computers, current content saving tools and habits, and demographic information.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn">VIEW SURVEY</a>
    <p>The survey revealed valuable information about how users saved and accessed their personal and professional information such as links, photos and notes.  It also revealed what tools they were using, what features were sought out, and where these tools were lacking.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="personas">
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p>I conducted in-depth interviews with three of the respondents to dive deeper into this data, to better understand who I would be designing DOX for and to ensure I am able to make informed decisions about DOX’s functionality and design.  These interviews helped me build personas that represent DOX's user goals and pain points.</p>

      <li><strong>Gender</strong> | Male</li>
      <div class="persona-content">
        <h6>MOTIVATION</h6>
        <p>Amit  is  an  avid  reader  and  frequently  saves  articles  to  read  when  he  is  on  the  go.    Since  heis  constantly  on  the  move,  he  most  often  uses  his  cell  phone  to  browse  the  internet  for  interesting  articles  or  content.    He  likes  to  be  able  to  access  content  from  anywhere,  not  juston  his  computer.    He  currently  works  in  a  very  collaborative  environment  and  uses  GoogleDrive  to  partner  with  his  colleagues  on  projects  in  real-time  but  finds  that  comments  andedits  crowd  the  document,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  read.</p>
          <h6>FRUSTRATIONS</h6>
          <li>- Downloaded material takes up too much space on device</li>
          <li>- Collaborating with others can become messy and documents are overburdened</li>
          <li>- Difficulty managing saved content</li>

          <p>Nicole  is  a  busy  mom  and  student,  so  she  relies  on  her  phone  to  keep  track  of  daily  activitiesand  to  save  content  that  is  useful  to  her.    She  typically  uses  Pinterest,  bookmarks  or  takes  screenshots  to  save  content  related  to  her  coursework,  baking  and  helpful  parenting  articles.    Since  her  commute  to  school  into  the  city  is  long  and  she  often  does  not  have  access  to  the  internet,  she  would  like  to  be  able  to  access  content  off-line.</p>
            <h6>FRUSTRATIONS</h6>
            <li>- Difficulty managing and organizing saved content</li>
            <li>- Unable to view content without access to the internet</li>

When  he  comes  across  content  that  interests  him,  he  typically  bookmarks  it,  takes  a  screenshot,  or  saves  it  in  its  respective  application.    He  is  currently  in  search  of  a  toolthat  allows  him  to  save  all  of  his  content  in  one  place,  since  keeping  track  of  it  all  has  becomeoverwhelming.</p>
              <h6>FRUSTRATIONS</h6>
              <li>- Managing saved content on multiple platforms is overwhelming</li>

          <p>These results help to solify Dox’s business requirements, and needs to:</p>
          <li>Be accessible on different devices, including mobile, and allow for syncing content across these devices</li>
          <li>Focus on content management and ways to quickly organize saved items</li>
          <li>Be simple to use</li>
          <li>Ensure collaboration and sharing resources available and easy to use</li>
          <li>Incorporate social media when signing up for an account</li>

  <div class="competitive-analysis">
    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>I conducted a SWOT analysis to evaluate three competitors: Pinterest, Box and Evernote.</p>

    <div class="comp-wrapper">
    <div class="competitor">
      <img src="assets/DOX/evernote.png" alt="google" width="50%">
      <div class="comp-content">
        <h4>Evernote</h4>
        <p>Is a well-known notetaking tool and also has the ability to store images, documents and web clippings.  The interface, however, can be difficult to use and the free version does not permit off-line viewing.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="competitor">
      <img src="assets/DOX/box.png" alt="detour" width=50%>
      <div class="comp-content">
        <h4>Box</h4>
        <p>Let's you securely manage, share and access saved content and puts an emphasis on their collaborative features, but real-time collaboration is difficult because people cannot work on the same document simultaneously, and is impractical for users that are just looking to store content for personal use.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="competitor">
      <img src="assets/DOX/pinterest.png" alt="livetrekker" width=50%>
      <div class="comp-content">
        <h4>Pinterest</h4>
        <p>Offers a quick and easy way to store and organize images and articles with one-click.  It does not, however, provide the capability to save other types of documents and is directed towards creatives.</p>
      </div>

    <p>Based on this research, it was clear that <strong>the application should focus on ease of use to ensure a low barrier of entry</strong>, and that <strong>an ability to generate personal customized maps could be a competitive advantage.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="user-flows">
    <h2>User Flows & Site Maps</h2>
    <p>Focusing on the main tasks of DOX users, I developed user stories for both new and returning users since each have different paths they take to achieve their goals for certain tasks.  Using these stories, I created a series of user flows and site maps that reflect the paths and actions a user would take to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Explore the features of DOX</li>
      <li>Sign-up/sign-in using social logins or email and password</li>
      <li>Navigate to the dashboard after signing up</li>
      <li>Reset password</li>
      <li>Adding new content (link, image or text-based note)</li>
      <li>Creating a new Dox Box</li>
      <li>Updating account settings</li>
      <li>Inviting and managing collaborators</li>
      <li>Viewing content</li>
    </ol>

<div class="phase">
  <h3>PHASE 2 : VISUAL DESIGN</h3>
</div>

<div class="branding">
  <h2>Branding</h2>
  <p>The logo was inspired by the concept of a shipping dock.  Like a Dock, Dox is a hub where images, links and notes are unloaded, giving direct access to users and collaborators.  While designing the logo, I wanted to create something that was simple and clean so I opted to use basic shapes and ultimately settled on my own interpretation of a ship’s sail.</p>

  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/K7u02xGB1cC7Umj9mQAx3Agb/Guide-Tribe-Style-Guide" class="btn">SEE COMPLETE STYLE GUIDE</a>
  <p>I chose blue and orange tones to convey that Dox is a reliable and trustworthy (blue tones) productivity tool that aims to facilitate collaboration and communication (orange tones) among users.</p>

<!-- PHASE 3 -->
<div class="phase">
  <h3>PHASE 3 : WIREFRAMING AND TESTING</h3>

<div class="wireframes">
  <h2>Wireframes</h2>
  <p>I translated my design notes and site maps into sketches to define the placement of elements for the homepage and dashboard.</p>
  <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/Wireframe Sketch.jpg" alt="LF sketch" width=100%>
  <p>After receiving informal feedback, I created an Invision prototype that I could test with potential users. The results of those user tests informed multiple iterations of flow design due to issues with wording and button placement.  Specifically, there were instances where instructions and prompts were unclear to users and that the placement of buttons did not adhere to user mental models.</p>
  <img src="assets/GUIDETRIBE/LOFI Wireframes.png" alt="LF wireframe" width=100%>
  <p>I designed high fidelity mockups in Sketch and Photoshop, incorporating the color palette, typography, visuals and further content details.  </p>

</div>

<div class="usability-testing">
  <div class="test">
    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
    <p>I used Invision to create a prototype that I used to survey and test potential users for more in-depth usability tests on UserTesting.com and UsabilityHub.com.</p>
    <img src="#" alt="HF wireframe" width=100%>
    <p>In addition to testing the overall navigation of DOX, I conducted a Preference Test to determine the placement of the “Add” button on the dashboard and a Nav Flow Test to determine potential issues in navigation when signing up for DOX and adding new content.</p>

      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="reflection-content">
      <p>I came out of this project with a real appreciation for the value of user research when designing a product.  The insights that came out of my own research addressed issues in the design process that helped produce a product that catered to user needs.</p>
      <p>If given more time I would have made minor adjustments to my design, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refining the footer in the homepage so that it doesn’t look as tight when in mobile and tablet formats</li>
        <li>Clarify terminology specific to DOX to new users on the homepage, i.e. what is a box?</li>
        <li>Add an internal search option to the dashboard to easily locate specific items</li>
        <li>Make it easier to locate additional features from the dashboard, i.e. collaboration</li>
