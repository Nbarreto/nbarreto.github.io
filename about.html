    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a User Experience Designer based in New York City who has a passion for how people think and behave.  I leverage my background in acting, psychology and my 8 years in Human Resources to solve both user and business problems in a thoughtful, empathetic and analytical way.</p>
    <p>My journey into User Experience Design began with acting.  I spent years jumping into the shoes of new characters and personas, which was always a welcomed challenge because it meant being able to explore important questions of empathy and behavior.</p>
    <p>I later pursued a degree in Psychology to satiate my fascination with why people do what they do.  What drives them?  What motivates them? I delved deep into human perception, motivation, bias, communication and emotion.  My goal was to use these skills to come up with real solutions for how people go about their lives.  After interning as a counselor on campus, I realized that I wanted to make an impact on a larger scale.</p>
    <p>I found myself a home in Human Resources, where I have spent the last 8 years helping to build the employee experience for a New York City based non-profit.  Through my work, I have seen how designing experiences in a way that considers employee needs can help elevate engagement. </p>
    <p>I transitioned into UX design because, while working in Human Resources, I have seen how technology can facilitate the way we live and work, but I have also seen how poorly designed products and processes can make living and working more difficult.  My goal is to design effective products and experiences that are meaningful and impactful.</p>
